                <h1><b>Consider Dog Daycare for Your Pup</b></h1>
                <p>While some dogs enjoy being home alone, others may require more excitement and activity. If your pup
                    fits into the latter category, then dog daycare may be the perfect fit! PupHub, a nationally
                    recognized all-inclusive dog care facility, offers the best dog daycare near you.</p>
                <p>Our core philosophy focuses on appropriate playtime and exercise for every pup in carefully selected
                    playgroups. Pups who participate in daycare at PupHub are more adjusted, less stressed, healthier,
                    and happier.</p>

            <h1>Benefits of Dog Daycare</h1>
            <p>There are a couple of added benefits when considering dog daycare for your furry family member.</p>

            <div class="recreation">
                <h1>Recreation</h1>
                <p>Your pet will be less likely to be destructive out of boredom. Pups that are left home alone can
                    express their separation anxiety through destructive behavior like chewing and clawing up your
                    belongings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="recreation">
                <h1>Exercise</h1>
                <p>Dog daycare is an outlet for their energy. Regular mental and physical exercise is critical for your
                    dog’s health, and at daycare, they’ll have a focused outlet for their excess energy.</p>

                <h1>Getaway</h1>
                <p>Your dog will thank you for the change of scenery. It doesn’t hurt to switch up your dog’s routine.
                    Dog daycare will be a mini-dogcation for your pet!</p>

                <h1>Custom-Tailored Groups</h1>
                <p>Not all dogs interact in the same way; that’s why we’re prepared for diverse groups that are assessed
                    for compatibility based on age and social behavior tendencies, rather than just size.  When it comes
                    to dog daycare, we believe that age is more important than size when evaluating compatibility.</p>
                <p>It’s our goal to ensure that all of our guests are stimulated both mentally and physically while in
                    our care. Our dog daycare facilities include spacious playrooms that are 100% fully supervised by
                    our staff of trained dog experts.</p>

            <h1>Daycare Prerequisites</h1>
            <p>The safety and health of your pet are our first concern. All dogs that participate in daycare must
                demonstrate adequate social skills and the ability to play safely. Additionally, all dogs over the age
                of seven months must be spayed or neutered.</p>
            <p>If we find your dog prefers people over dogs, they will instead receive personal playtime with our canine
                handlers.</p>
            <p>Before overnight boarding and/or dog daycare services, you must provide proof of the following up-to-date
                vaccinations from your vet:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Bordetella</b></p>
                    <p>The Bordetella vaccine is a non-core vaccine that is administered to both dogs and cats that
                        frequent daycare or boarding facilities to decrease likelihood of developing canine
                        tracheobronchitis, commonly known as kennel cough.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Parvovirus & Distemper</b></p>
                    <p>The two most commonly diagnosed systemic viral conditions in dogs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Rabies</b></p>
                    <p>The rabies vaccine is classed as an immunizing agent, which involves injecting a deactivated
                        strain of the virus into the pet, which in turn prompts the dog’s immune system to produce
                        antibodies to the virus, thereby protecting them against later contracting an active strain of
                        the disease.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please note, that we will accept titer tests for Distemper and Rabies. We also require that your dog be
                on a regular flea and tick prevention program, such as Frontline or Advantage. (Flea Powders/Collars are
                not acceptable, with the exception of the Seresto Collar.)</p>
            <p>Dogs over 7 months must be spayed or neutered in order to participate in daycare, however they may still
                be boarded.</p>
