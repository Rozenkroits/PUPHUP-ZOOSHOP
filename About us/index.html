       <div class="About_us">
        <p>The owners of PupHub spent several years researching the pet care industry, surveying the needs of local pet owners, and planning an all-inclusive pet care facility after they saw a lack of transparency in the industry. Their goal was to create a fun and safe environment where dogs would love to come and play, and pet owners would feel 100% confident in the superior care that their dogs were receiving.</p>
        <p>In 2009, the first PupHup doors opened in Pittsburgh, PA. Since that day, PupHub’s mission has been to deliver a superior experience for the dogs and their whole families by providing a safe environment, offering educational opportunities, anticipating and exceeding the needs of clients and their pet companions, instilling complete peace of mind for those we serve – and to earn their trust every day!</p>
        <p>Today, there are over 25 Stops in twelve different states including Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington, with over 50 more Stops opening in the near future.  Each Stop is locally owned and operated, but was bred and trained on the original PupHup morals and mission. PupHub is here to offer an all-inclusive pet care facility with honest and reliable pet care solutions so that you can be the awesome pet parent you need to be!</p>
