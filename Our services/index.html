                <h1>Daycare</h1>
                <p><i>PupHup’s goal is to ensure that all of our guests are stimulated both mentally and physically
                        while in our care. Dogs that join us for dog daycare enjoy spacious indoor/outdoor supervised
                        group play areas featuring interactive elements, such as benches, bridges, wading pools, and, of
                        course, our canine handlers. Since not all dogs play alike, we are prepared for many different
                        playgroups that are separated primarily by age and playstyle. We believe that age is more
                        important than size when evaluating compatibility for dog daycare. Pups who participate in
                        daycare at PupHup are more adjusted, less stressed, healthier and happier.</i></p>
