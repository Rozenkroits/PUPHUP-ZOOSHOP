                <p>Doggie Daycare is included for all of our overnight dog boarding guests who meet our group play
                    requirements. This allows your furry friend to enjoy hours of playtime with other pups. Each play
                    area is under the careful supervision of our canine companions. Have a pup that prefers people? Not
                    a problem. Our canine handlers will make sure they still receive plenty of personalized playtimes.

            <h1>Boarding Prerequisites</h1>
            <p>The safety and health of your pet is our first concern. PupHub Play/Stay contract includes a personality
                profile so we have basic information about your dog to match him with the right playmates. All boarding
                dogs that participate in daycare must demonstrate adequate social skills and the ability to play safely.
                On the first overnight stay at PupHub, we will evaluate your dog’s interactions with other guests. If we
                find your dog isn’t appropriate for group play, they will instead receive personal playtime with our
                canine companions.</p>
            <h3><b>Vaccinations & Flea/Tick Requirements</b></h3>
            <p>Prior to overnight boarding and/or dog daycare services, you must provide proof of the following
                vaccinations from your vet:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Bordetella – Up-to-date vaccinations</li>
                <li>Parvovirus & Distemper – Up-to-date vaccinations</li>
                <li>Rabies – Up-to-date vaccinations</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Please note, that we also accept titer tests for Distemper and Rabies. We also require that your dog be
                on a regular flea and tick prevention program, such as Frontline or Advantage. (Flea Powders/Collars are
                not acceptable, with the exception of the Seresto Collar.)</p>
            <p>Dogs over 7 months must be spayed or neutered in order to participate in daycare, however they may still
                be boarded.</p>
